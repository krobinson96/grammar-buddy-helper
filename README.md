This class allows the user to instantiate a GrammarBuddyHelper object which allows the creation of grammar using Backus-Naur Form notation. 
Included with the class are sample grammar text files which demonstrate how the grammar is to be notated in order to be read and used by the object.

## Usage
The top-level main() function can be edited to test out the functionality of the class. The only constructor that is included is GrammarBuddyHelper(),
which accepts a list of rules in the form of "symbol delimiter expression." If a new symbol is to be added, addSymbol() checks if the symbol is already 
added and does not add a duplicate if it already is. An entirely new rule can be defined using addExpression(), as it also checks if the symbol and
expression exist in the grammar already. The saveMap() function allows the current grammar to be saved under the default path 'BNF Forms/[File Name].txt'
